# Longest-Common-Sub-sequence
Dynamic programming algorithm for the Longest Common Sub- Sequence Problem

Input: Reads the input graph from the file \input.txt". The file contains two lines,
each containing one string. You can assume each string only contains upper and lower case
letters and numbers; the length of each string is at most 1000.

Output: Writes output to the file \output.txt". The first line of the file is an integer
indicating the length of the longest common subsequence between the two strings. The second
line contains the longest common subsequence (which may not be unique).
